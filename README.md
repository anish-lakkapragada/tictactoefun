# tictactoefun

So I got bored on Memorial Day and decided to create some what of an 
"algorithm" for the computer to play tictactoe against with the user. The 
computer always plays first and starts at a random position (it was pretty 
hard for me to beat it when it started in the center - maybe that says more
about my tictactoe skills or the program.) 

please improve upon it 
thanks
